Both the weather station and the base station utilized the Programmable System-on-Chip (PSoC) platform as their main architecture. This platform facilitated the processing of data collected from digital sensors and interpretation of the data to be displayed on a TFT LCD display.

It supports several customization options which can be set by the user in a configuration menu and is designed in parallel manner, which can allow multiple Chip-8 instances to run on the same processor. The project was coded in Verilog.

I was tasked to create an inexpensive modular optical density sensor system that autonomously measures the density of spirulina grown in artificial environments to examine the effects of temperature on the size and shape of spirulina. The purpose of this device was to analyze how climate change affects spirulina, a blue-green algae that is a source of food for many aquatic species and has a spiral shape that changes with respect to increases in water temperature.

                            <p>I wanted to find an affordable way to remove arsenic from well water, a major issue in Maine. With no lab access due to the pandemic, I converted my basement into a makeshift lab to experiment with arsenic-removal compounds.</p>   
                            <p>I developed a novel and inexpensive water purification system that can remove Arsenic from well water employing Carbon Nanotubes (CNT) and Iron-Oxide in a matrix derived from Calcium Alginate. My solution was an equitable alternative that was 90x cheaper than commercialized Arsenic treatment.</p>

                            <p>During the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, I found that there was a lacking in a comprehensive platform to spread Anti-Racism resources to the public. So, I decided to build the platform myself. I self-taught myself HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create the educational website that is now “Reform the Narrative” which aims to help users have centralized access to anti-racism resources. 
                            </p>
                            <p>I collaborated with local schools to develop marketing, graphic design, and new features for the site. I also wanted to include a storytelling component to “Reform the Narrative” in order to amplify the voices of students from underrepresented communities by conducting interviews about their stories.</p>
