                                is MIT's famous Senior Mechanical Engineering Capstone class, where students are put into teams of ~15 who work together through the product development cycle from ideation, design, to alpha prototype. Our theme this year was "Balance"!

                                I was on Yellow Team and I served as 1 of 2 system integrators. As described by the 2.009 website, "the system integrators will assume a number of coordination and integration functions during the project, from both a project management and technical design viewpoint. While they are not the owners of the design vision (the team is), they are the hub of team communication."

                                We started out with over 100 product opportunities, ranging from categories of home-use, medical, to mobile safety. From those concepts, we split into subteams and narrowed down to six compelling problems/opportunities to explore, focusing on unmet needs rather than solutions. I specifically worked on the subteam of "accountability & independence in medical care." Each team delivers elevator pitches for each opportunity during a 6-minute presentation to showcase their most promising ideas, derived from research, observations, and brainstorming. This helped us refine problem identification skills and provides exposure to opportunities being considered by classmates.

                                We then developed four product concepts and assess their feasibility by identifying key risks and building models (physical, numerical, or analytic) to address them. We evaluated each concept based on feasibility, market potential, user needs, and unique value propositions. This includes conducting market research, benchmarking, and gathering user feedback to create a user persona. Findings from these analyses guided our selection of one concept to pursue for further development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For our feasibility analysis, we developed four concepts: Hands-Free Crutch, Fire Suppression Systems in Shredder Facilities, Retractable Training Wheels, and Smart Cast to help with muscle atrophy. I contributed as part of the Hands-Free Crutch subteam, focusing on the limitations of traditional crutches in mobility and convenience. We conducted market research on the crutch industry and analyzed the user space by examining injury types. A key insight was the distinction between the consumer persona (doctors prescribing the device) and the user persona (patients using it), which shaped our approach to product development.

                                After evaluating our four concepts and conducting user interviews, we chose to focus on the Smart Cast, which addresses the clear need to prevent muscle atrophy during recovery. This led us to explore the broader rehabilitation space, where we identified accountability in physical therapy—especially post–total knee replacement—as a key challenge. With a $9.4B market growing at 5.1% annually, we saw potential in improving recovery outcomes through consistent physical therapy, which can speed up healing by 20–30% and reduce long-term costs by 10–15%. However, current barriers like limited mobility, scheduling issues, and high in-clinic costs reduce adherence. We aimed to develop a wearable that tracks PT exercises and improves patient–therapist communication.

                            <p>
                                We focused on developing our most critical module: the sensing technology for detecting patient exercises by measuring knee range of motion. We tested various sensors and ultimately selected an IMU for its accuracy and ease of integration. Additionally, we explored Bluetooth connectivity to enable data transmission from the patient to the physical therapist. This milestone allowed us to refine our product architecture, validate high-risk components, and gather valuable design feedback through physical prototyping.

                                The Technical Review assesses the functionality of each team's final prototype and provides critical feedback to guide improvements before the final presentation. We had to present a fully functional, testable prototype, demonstrating that all technical features are operational. Addressing key technical challenges early was essential for allowing time to debug and have a successful system integration.

                                Sensors: We evaluated both raw IMUs with custom calculations and pre-packaged IMUs, ultimately selecting the latter for smoother integration.

Each team showcased their work through a 7-minute polished presentation, demonstrating their alpha prototype—a detailed, looks-like and works-like version of the final product. The presentation highlighted key design merits, technical innovations, user impact, and potential market realization. We presented our product to a live audience of ~1,000 people with an online audience of ~10,000!!
